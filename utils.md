# Utilities

List of programs that I use to do neat things.

Partly if anyone else wants ideas, but also just so I don't forget to install
them all when I inevitably distro-hop again.

* [`cb`](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard) - universal clipboard
  manipulation from the command line.

* [`cloudflared`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) - to allow SSH to
  my server even though it is tunnelled.

* [`dcc`](https://github.com/COMP1511UNSW/dcc) - a friendly C compiler that I
  sometimes use when teaching.

* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - the only note-taking app I've found that
  works with my brain

* [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - quick and easy ZSH niceness. Kinda slow, so
  I might look into some other tools sometime -
  [Starship](https://starship.rs/) looks awesome.

* [`rmview`](https://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview) -
  [ReMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) screen-sharing over wired SSH (no WiFi
  required).

* [`scc`](https://github.com/boyter/scc) - count lines of code in a folder.

* [`solaar`](https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar) - Linux config for Logitech
  mice and keyboards.

* [`thef*ck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) - Magnificent app which corrects
  your previous console command.
