# Utilities

List of programs that I use to do neat things.

Partly if anyone else wants ideas, but also just so I don't forget to install
them all when I inevitably distro-hop again.

* [`scc`](https://github.com/boyter/scc) - count lines of code in a folder
* [`cb`](https://github.com/Slackadays/Clipboard) - universal clipboard
  manipulation from the command line.
* [`rmview`](https://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview) -
  [ReMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) screen-sharing over wired SSH (no WiFi
  required).
* [`solaar`](https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar) - Linux config for Logitech
  mice and keyboards.
* [`dcc`](https://github.com/COMP1511UNSW/dcc) - a friendly C compiler that I
  sometimes use when teaching.
* [`thef*ck`](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) - Magnificent app which corrects
  your previous console command.
